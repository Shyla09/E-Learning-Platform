# E-Learning-Platform
# 🎓 E-Learning Platform (C++ OOP Project)

A console-based **E-Learning System** built in **C++**, demonstrating the use of **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts such as *inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and file handling*.  
Students can register, take quizzes, submit assignments, and track progress — while instructors can create courses, manage quizzes, and grade submissions.
